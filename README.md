# Automated Dual-Axis Solar Panel

# What?
The idea was to design a solar panel system that could automatically follow the sun throughout the day, maximizing energy capture compared to fixed panels.<img width="1238" height="765" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea3ac236-e1f7-4df5-8c6c-f5220cef3ccd" />

# How?
Built an Arduino-based control system that used four photoresistors (LDRs) to detect light intensity and calculate sun position.
Integrated servo motors for panel rotation along two axes powered by external 5V supply.
Designed and 3D-printed housing and rotational mounts to secure the solar panel and allow smooth movement.
Created a custom wiring board to connect sensors, power supply, and servo motors neatly.
# Results
The tracker successfully followed the sunâ€™s position across different times of day and lighting conditions.
Demonstrated that an active tracker could significantly increase solar panel exposure compared to a fixed position.
